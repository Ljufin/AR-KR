# CS480:  Knowledge Representation and Automatic Reasoning

This repository is for the projects that I worked on while in this class. There were also a few other assignments that were not
included, but these were either very simple homeworks/labs or reading assignments. I really didn't want to upload 30 Word docs that
aren't very interesting.

## About the class:

The class was taught in Spring 2017 at Biola University by Dr. Shieu-Hong Lin. This was a seminar style class with 5 students, one of 
which was mostly absent since he was working on an independent study related to the topic. Our class levels were sophomore through senior.
We used the book "Constraint Logic Programming using ECLiPSe" by Krzysztof R. Apt and Mark G. Wallace. As you may have guessed from the
title of the book, we used the ECLiPSe Constraint Programming System, which can be found at http://eclipseclp.org/. The assignments
consisted of weekly readings and programming assignments.
